# Us and Them - Mapping Discourse Coalitions in the EU Copyright Directive Debate

This project was part of my master thesis and aimed to examine the debate surrounding the EU Copyright Directive by conducting a discourse network analysis of the process. Text sources were qualitatively coded using the Discourse Network Analyzer and their network properties analysed and visualised using packages in R.

## Abstract

The European Parliament approved the most recent Copyright Directive in March 2019, ending a 3-year legislative process punctuated by a fierce debate between its proponents and critics. This research combines Hajer’s argumentative discourse analysis framework with the methodological approach of discourse network analysis to comprehensibly map the discourse coalitions engaged in this debate, scrutinise their characteristics, and appraise their influence over the policy process and outcome. It does so through the dynamic examination of the relations between both actors and their arguments over time by using open letters and statements as text sources annotated and coded using the Discourse Network Analyzer (DNA) software. The resulting network data is subsequently exported for further analysis and visualisation. The mapping reveals that this debate featured, on the one side, two coalitions who argued against the directive on the basis of its threats to the civil rights and to the EU’s economy and research environment, and on the other side, proponents of the reform assembled in one coalition who stressed the importance of protecting the creative sector and reducing the market power of online platforms. It demonstrates that no discourse coalition achieved discursive hegemony over the debate, with the discourse of both opponents and proponents being partially institutionalised in the policy outcome, albeit to a different extent. Despite being characterised by a higher internal cohesion, a more densely clustered structure and a more important network influence than the pro-directive coalition, opponents of the directive wielded a limited influence on the policy outcome, particular regarding the most contentious provisions, Article 11 and Article 13. The pro-directive coalition displayed less discursive congruence but experienced the most important relative increase in terms of size and network influence throughout the debate, and its discourse was reflected to a greater degree in the adopted law. The commodification of knowledge being a persistent policy issue, this discursive contestation is expected to continue in future intellectual property rights conflicts.
