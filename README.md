# Mapping Discourse Coalitions in the EU Copyright Directive Debate
This project was part of my master thesis and aimed to examine the debate surrounding the EU Copyright Directive by conducting a discourse network analysis of the process. Text sources were qualitatively coded using the Discourse Network Analyzer and their network properties analysed and visualised using packages in R.
